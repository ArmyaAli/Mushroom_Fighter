Gameplay notes
---------------------
2 player game only - Easier for my development. NO "AI" at this time. I do not wish to program a computer player at this point. Would like a working game first (AI CAN BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT)
Controller support
Health bars
2D fighting game
Each character will have different attacks
	Each character should be named
	Each character attack should be named
	Each character should have a corresponding Attack/Control help menu and a description
Mushroom theme - One character should be a mushroom !important
Raylib will be used for graphics (opengl backend) and interfacing with OS + peripherals (It has controller support!!)

NOTES:
Raylib is single threaded (OPENGL limitation)
